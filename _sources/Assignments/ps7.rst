Activities through 3/12
=======================

* **Before class Monday 3/6:**

  * Review the :ref:`Flickr API<flickr_api_chap>` and `this document about APIs and Caching <https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Rest-APIs-and-Caching-506W17-draft-GUSnNpkwXNWBaXIQs451y>`_ from last week. (**NOTE** that the flickr code chapter has a section about caching that we are *not* using in this class. It is more important to focus on the caching document and understanding caching data; we will discuss this more in class this week!)
  * You do not see a Lecture Prep assignment worth points for today because we cannot check whether or not you've read the document again, etc (we trust that you will).


* **Before class Wednesday 3/8:**

  * Check out the `Flickr Photos Search API documentation <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html>`_ and the `Flickr Photo API documentation <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html>`_. Consider:
  	* How would you compose an API request that searches for photos tagged "mountains"?
  	* How would you compose an API request to get a bunch of information about one particular photo? What information do you need to have about that photo to do so?
  * Both of these links can be found here, `at the description of ALL of the Flickr API endpoints, or services <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/>`_. Glance over this link, click around... what questions do you have? What is most confusing about this? What makes sense? What does the documentation at each of these links mean to you? (Each represents one *endpoint* -- like what you need to know to use one base url to get a certain set of data from Flickr.)



* **Before SundayÂ 3/12 at 11:59 PM:**

  * Complete all of :ref:`Problem Set 7 <problem_set_7>` and submit the Demonstrate Your Understanding assignment for this week on Canvas (linked in Problem Set below).

.. _problem_set_7:

Problem Set
-----------

Go `HERE to see the Problem Set 7 assignment <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/108426/assignments/139255>`_, where you can find the files you need to download and edit, and where you can submit files for this assignment. (Note that there are multiple files you will need to download this week!)

Much like the last couple weeks, you'll see abbreviated instructions and provided code for each step in the ``506_ps7.py`` file you download from Canvas. Here on this page, you'll see extended instructions for each problem.

.. note::

	Reminder: we do not debug code when grading, so we cannot grade code that does not run! Make sure your code runs before submitting it -- you should comment out any code that does not.

**PROBLEM SET CONTENT TBA.  THIS PROBLEM SET IS CURRENTLY BEING EDITED TO ALIGN WITH OUR COURSE. This message will be removed when it is completed.****
