Activities through 3/12
=======================

* **Before class Monday 3/6:**

  * Review the :ref:`Flickr API<flickr_api_chap>` and :ref:`Caching Responses<caching_responses>` from last week.
  * We are posting a file on Canvas in Files > Code Samples that shows code to access the Flickr API which is commented thoroughly. You should download this, look at it, and try it out!

.. usageassignment::
  :subchapters: UsingRESTAPIs/cachingResponses, UsingRESTAPIs/flickr
  :assignment_name: Lecture Prep 13
  :deadline: 2017-03-06 17:30
  :pct_required: 65
  :points: 50 

* **Before class Wednesday 3/8:**

  * Check out the Flickr API documentation linked in the textbook. Consider:
  	* How would you use it to compose an API request that searches for photos tagged "mountains"?
  	* How would you use it to compose an API request to get a bunch of data about one particular photo? What information do you need to have about that photo to do so?


* **Before SundayÂ 3/12 at 11:59 PM:**

  * Complete all of :ref:`Problem Set 7 <problem_set_7>` and submit the Demonstrate Your Understanding assignment for this week on Canvas (linked in Problem Set below).

.. _problem_set_7:

Problem Set
-----------

Go `HERE to see the Problem Set 7 assignment <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/108426/assignments/139255>`_, where you can find the files you need to download and edit, and where you can submit files for this assignment. (Note that there are multiple files you will need to download this week!)

Much like the last couple weeks, you'll see abbreviated instructions and provided code for each step in the ``506_ps7.py`` file you download from Canvas. Here on this page, you'll see extended instructions for each problem.

.. note::

	Reminder: we do not debug code when grading, so we cannot grade code that does not run! Make sure your code runs before submitting it -- you should comment out any code that does not.

**PROBLEM SET CONTENT TBA**
