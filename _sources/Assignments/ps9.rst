Activities through 3/26
=======================

* **Before class Monday 3/20:**

  * Read about the :ref:`Facebook API <fb_api_exercises>`.
  * Read the `Facebook Graph API overview <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview>`_
  * Try out the `Facebook Graph API Explorer <https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/>`_. You should try at least a couple different requests in the explorer and explore the resulting data (try copying it into jsoneditoronline.org!).
  * Read about `Paging with the Facebook API <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#paging>`_, focusing on **Offset-based pagination**, which we will focus on in lecture / will discuss further on Wednesday.
  * ``fbapi.py`` is not on Canvas -- focus at first on playing with the Graph explorer and understanding what's happening in the explained code.

Problem Set
-----------

* Note that if you do not have a Facebook account, **you will need one for this unit.** However, it does not have to be real, it does not have to use your real name, and you can delete it when this class is over! If you do use Facebook, you do not have to share any of your personal data if you use your own account for this assignment. When we run your code, we will be seeing our own data, not yours.

* Find files to download and instructions on Canvas at Files > Problem Sets > PS9

* **You should submit `to the Problem Set 9 assignment <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/150918/assignments/231797>`_:**

  * Your edited problem set file
  * Your ``emo_scores.csv`` file
  * Your cache file, ``506W17_PS9_caching.json``

**In this problem set, you will:**

* Write a function to access and cache data from Facebook
* Finish defining a class to hold/represent post data from Facebook
* Store data from Facebook in class instances
* Do further data manipulation and write results to a CSV file
