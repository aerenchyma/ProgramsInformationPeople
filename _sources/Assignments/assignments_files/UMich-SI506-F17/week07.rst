Activities: Week 7 (this is the week that includes the Mon-Tues of Fall Break)
==============================================================================

* **No class Monday because of Fall Break**

* **Remember that your Unix Problems are due immediately after fall break, on 10/18 at 11:59 PM, on Canvas**. You can see the assignment: :ref:`Unix Problems<unix_problems>`

* **Before class Thursday:**
  
  * Read :ref:`Sorting and anonymous functions<sort_chap>`
  * Try all the exercises you can and try to formulate questions about concepts you find confusing/articulate ways of solving exercises in English.
  * Make sure your Python installation is working properly.
  * Read just the :ref:`introduction to Unit Testing<test_cases_chap>`. (We will discuss this in lecture! You do *not* have to read the rest of this chapter beyond the introductory section; it addresses material you have NOT learned yet in this course. We will focus in more depth on that material later in the semester. But this week is the first time you will see the code for Unit Tests, so we will teach you how to understand the output you get from them when you run problem sets on your own computer.)


* **Before Sunday 11:59 PM:**

  * Save answers to Problem Set 5, below.

Your next DYU, **Demonstrate Understanding 6**, is due **October 29** to give you time to get readjusted from the midterm, but you may get started on it at any time! You've already done all of the readings necessary to complete it.
