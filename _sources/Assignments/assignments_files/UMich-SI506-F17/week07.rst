Activities: Week 7
==================

** This week's problem set is temporarily unavailable and will be added.**

* **No class Monday because of Fall Break**

* **Remember that your Unix Problems are due after fall break, on 10/18 at 11:59 PM, on Canvas**. You can see the assignment: :ref:`Unix Problems<unix_problems>`

* **Before class Thursday:**
  
  * Read :ref:`Sorting and anonymous functions<sort_chap>`
  * Try all the exercises you can and try to formulate questions about concepts you find confusing/articulate ways of solving exercises in English.
  * Make sure your Python installation is working properly and bring any questions to your discussion section.
  * Read just the :ref:`introduction to Unit Testing<test_cases_chap>`. (We will discuss this in lecture! You do *not* have to read the rest of this chapter beyond the introductory section; it addresses material you have NOT learned yet in this course. We will focus in more depth on that material later in the semester. But this week is the first time you will see the code for Unit Tests, so we will teach you how to understand the output you get from them when you run problem sets on your own computer.)
