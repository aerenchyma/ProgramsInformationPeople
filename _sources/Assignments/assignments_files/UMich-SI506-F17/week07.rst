Activities: Week 6 (through fall break)
=======================================

* **Before class Monday:**
  
  * Read :ref:`Nested Data and Nested Iteration<nested_chap>` and try exercises in the section. Trying out and playing around with this code prior to lecture is especially important!
  * Read :ref:`Try/Except <exceptions_chap>`


* **Wednesday's class:**

  * **Your midterm occurs in class today.** Additional information provided in class.


* **Over fall break:**

  * No Problem Set due until the following Sunday, but you should *definitely* get started on the reading and do as much of it as you can -- it's important to understand as clearly as you can so you can ask questions in class!
  * **Make sure your installation and Python setup on your computer is working and feels clear to you. Contact an instructor before Fall Break if this is not the case. This is very important!**
  * You should check out the :ref:`How to Fix Common Problems using your native machine's Python<gotchas_chap>`, which may also be helpful as we move forward.
