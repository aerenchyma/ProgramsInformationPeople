Problem Set

Go `HERE to see the Problem Set 8 assignment <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/150918/assignments/231796>`_, where you can find the file you need to download and edit, and where you can submit the completed file for this assignment. 

Much like the last couple weeks, you'll see instructions and provided code for each step in the ``506W17_ps8.py`` file you download from Canvas. 

Remember that we do not grade files which do not run, so make sure that your file runs and shows test output before submitting it. Comment out any code that causes an error!
